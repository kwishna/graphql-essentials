## Introduction

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, efficiently fetching information from the server. It provides a more flexible and efficient way to interact with APIs compared to REST.

This project introduces you to the foundational concepts of GraphQL through step-by-step examples and a simple, hands-on project that you can follow along with.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js
- Familiarity with APIs
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed
